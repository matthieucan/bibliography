  abstract = {Wireless networks are today an entire part of the Internet, and are often used by companies and particularies. Security of information is thus important, and protocols like WEP and WPA can be attacked. We present in this report the existent WLANs protocols, an overview of the most efficient attacks on them and two attacks we have found on WEP.},

  title = {Debsources: Live and Historical Views on Macro-Level Software Evolution},
  abstract = {Context. Software evolution has been an active field of research in recent years, but studies on macro-level software evolution---i.e., on the evolution of large software collections over many years---are scarce, despite the increasing popularity of intermediate vendors as a way to deliver software to final users. Goal. We want to ease the study of both day-by-day and long-term Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) evolution trends at the macro-level, focusing on the Debian distribution as a proxy of relevant FOSS projects. Method. We have built Debsources, a software platform to gather, search, and publish on the Web all the source code of Debian and measures about it. We have set up a public Debsources instance at http://sources.debian.net, integrated it into the Debian infrastructure to receive live updates of new package releases, and written plugins to compute popular source code metrics. We have injected all current and historical Debian releases into it. Results. The obtained dataset and Web portal provide both long term-views over the past 20 years of FOSS evolution and live insights on what is happening at sub-day granularity. By writing simple plugins (~100 lines of Python each) and adding them to our Debsources instance we have been able to easily replicate and extend past empirical analyses on metrics as diverse as lines of code, number of packages, and rate of change---and make them perennial. We have obtained slightly different results than our reference study, but confirmed the general trends and updated them in light of 7 extra years of evolution history. Conclusions. Debsources is a flexible platform to monitor large FOSS collections over long periods of time. Its main instance and dataset are valuable resources for scholars interested in macro-level software evolution.},

  title = {The Debsources Dataset: Two Decades of Free and Open Source Software},
  abstract = {We present the Debsources Dataset: source code and related metadata spanning two decades of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) history, seen through the lens of the Debian distribution. The dataset spans more than 3 billion lines of source code as well as metadata about them such as: size metrics (lines of code, disk usage), developer-defined symbols (ctags), file-level checksums (SHA1, SHA256, TLSH), file media types (MIME), release information (which version of which package containing which source code files has been released when), and license information (GPL, BSD, etc). The Debsources Dataset comes as a set of tarballs containing deduplicated unique source code files organized by their SHA1 checksums (the source code), plus a portable PostgreSQL database dump (the metadata). A case study is run to show how the Debsources Dataset can be used to easily and efficiently instrument very long-term analyses of the evolution of Debian from various angles (size, granularity, licensing, etc.), getting a grasp of major FOSS trends of the past two decades. The Debsources Dataset is Open Data, released under the terms of the CC BY-SA 4.0 license, and available for download from Zenodo with DOI reference 10.5281/zenodo.61089.},
